      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of experience in Rails. I&amp;rsquo;ve used it over the last year, but most of my time during that period has been in Elixir.
Recently, due to how Postgres partial indexes work, I wanted to replace some parameter markers in my queries with manifest (i.e., hard coded) values. This was only for things like processing states and the like. I still wanted values like keys and dates to be parameterized for DB efficiency.</description>

      <title>Postgres Partial Indexes</title>

      <description>I have a large Postgres database that backs some data services used by a few other apps. This database is not large by Postgres standards, having about 600M rows.
I did some reading on Postgres indexes and decided that a series of partial indexes would likely provide the best performance for our variety of queries. However, I was confused that while my analysis revealed that the indexes I created would serve those queries well, Postgres never seemed to use them.</description>
