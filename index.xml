      <title>Ecto Migrate To</title>

      <description>Ecto has a nice feature that allows a target migration to be specified.
The example is:
mix ecto.migrate --to 20080906120000  The ID above is the prefix of the migration file name.
I used this when I had a set of migrations to run, but needed to do intermediate work as each one was applied. This made it really easy.</description>

      <title>Unbalanced Postgres Partitions</title>

      <description>I recently needed to partition a large table in Postgres. The table is approaching 600M rows. It had a sufficient number of rows that I was not able to create an index without running out of temporary storage on my cloud-hosted server.
Most of my reading on Postgres partitioning talked about partitioning by date. However, few of my queries are of the &amp;ldquo;recent rows&amp;rdquo; variety, so that didn&amp;rsquo;t seem like an optimal approach.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of experience in Rails. I&amp;rsquo;ve used it over the last year, but most of my time during that period has been in Elixir.
Recently, due to how Postgres partial indexes work, I wanted to replace some parameter markers in my queries with manifest (i.e., hard coded) values. This was only for things like processing states and the like. I still wanted values like keys and dates to be parameterized for DB efficiency.</description>

      <title>Postgres Partial Indexes</title>

      <description>I have a large Postgres database that backs some data services used by a few other apps. This database is not large by Postgres standards, having about 600M rows.
I did some reading on Postgres indexes and decided that a series of partial indexes would likely provide the best performance for our variety of queries. However, I was confused that while my analysis revealed that the indexes I created would serve those queries well, Postgres never seemed to use them.</description>
